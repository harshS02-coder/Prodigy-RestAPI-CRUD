# Prodigy-RestAPI-CRUD
This project is part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech. It demonstrates the development of a simple and efficient RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js with an in-memory data store (no database integration).

The API supports full CRUD operations â€” Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

Features
Create new records (POST)
Retrieve all or single records (GET)
Update existing records (PUT)
Delete records (DELETE)
Simple and modular code using Express Router
In-memory data storage (resets on server restart)

Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Data Store: In-memory (JavaScript array or object)
Tools: Postman or any REST client for testing
